# R Markdown

R Markdown is a powerful tool for creating reproducible documents that contain code, output, and text. It allows you to embed R code and output directly in your document, and can even include interactive elements like plots and tables.

## The Markdown Format

Headings: To create a heading, you can use the `#` symbol followed by a space and the heading text. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading. For example, to create a level-1 heading, you can use the following syntax:

#### this is a subheading

##### this is a sub-sub heading

Paragraphs: To create a paragraph, you can simply type the text and leave a blank line before and after the paragraph.

Emphasis: To add emphasis to text, you can use the * symbol to create italic text or the ** symbol to create bold text. For example, to create italic text, you can use the following syntax:

*this text is in italics*

**this text is bold**

Lists: To create a bulleted list, you can use the - symbol followed by a space. For example:

- item1
- item2
- item3

To create a numbered list, you can use the `1.` syntax followed by a space. For example:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Links: To create a link, you can use the `[text](url)` syntax. For example:

[Google](https://www.google.com)

Images: To include an image, you can use the `![alt text](image url)` syntax. The `alt text` is a description of the image that will be displayed if the image is not able to be displayed. For example:

#![cat](https://www.example.com/cat.jpg)

## Create Markdown docuemnts in R
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To create an R Markdown document, you will need to install the rmarkdown package and create a new file with the `.Rmd` extension. You can do this by running the following code:

```{r install_markdown}
#install.packages("rmarkdown")
#rmarkdown::draft("my-document.Rmd", template = "default", package = "rmarkdown")
```

This will open a new R Markdown file in your default text editor. 

You can aslo create a new R Markdown file using the `File > New File > R Markdown...` menu in R Studio.
The file will contain some basic YAML metadata, as well as a few example code chunks and text blocks.

To include a code chunk in your document, you can use the following syntax:

```{r}
# R code goes here
```

## Kintting your document
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Customizing your code chunk
You can include various statements with your code, for example `echo = FALSE` prevents printing of the R code that generated the plot:

```{r cars2, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

Including the label `include = FALSE` prevents the code chunk from returnign any output at all. This is useful when you want to run some code in the background that sould not apear on your script.

```{r cars3, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## The `.yaml` Header

R Markdown allows to a variety of different file types. They are specified in the 
`.yaml` header:

In Markdown, a YAML header is a block of YAML code at the beginning of a Markdown file that is used to define metadata for the document. The YAML header is usually surrounded by `---` on the top and bottom and is used to specify information such as the document title, author, and other metadata, such as font size and margin size. It can contain any `.yaml` key.

Here is an example of a YAML header in a Markdown file:



```{r, interactive=TRUE}
library(knitr)
plot(1:10)
```
